## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries for mobile design
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap 4 library


### What I learned
I tried to use bootstrap as a css library and I struggled a bit to get the alignments that I wanted maybe because bootstrap comes with a css file styling all the elements of the document file. 

I learned a bit about toggle menu even though my own isn't working perfectly, I tried to make some research but haven't figured out what was the issue and I'm opened for any recommendation and tips to perfect my skills.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

Some javaScript I've learnt.
```js
var navLinks = document.getElementById("nav-links");

    function showMenu() {
      navLinks.style.marginRight = "0";
    }

    function hideMenu() {
      navLinks.style.marginRight = "-200px";
    }
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I would like to focus more on JavaScript DOM to design more interactive and responsive design. I would like also to know how to use Bootstrap which is powerfull tool for projects designing.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Youtube video on toggle menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYRda7UtuhA&t=28s) - This is an amazing video which helped me design the toggle menu.
